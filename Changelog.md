# 0.5
- Add `itemsFactory(itemsCount:factory:)` method which can be used instead of items variable to set the carousel views.
- **Breaking change** Replace convenience init `init(frame:choices:)` to `init(frame:items:)`.
- Change Example2 to use `itemsFactory(itemsCount:factory:)` instead of `items`.
- Improve `UIView().copyView()` (it will copy also constraints now for view & subviews).

# 0.4.1
- Quickfix to bug that was created by 0.4, when you scrolled one on the left or right, the scroll would freak out.
- Fix to default selecting, now it behaves correctly.

# 0.4
- ðŸš€Fixed bug when you spinned the carousel while it was spinning. When you did this, the carousel would mess up the destination target and wouldnâ€™t really select the item in the middle, but slightly off.

# 0.3
- Clicking (or tapping) on item now by default selects the item in carousel.

# 0.2.2
- Fixed `selectItem(_:animated)`.

# 0.2
- Moved from scroll delegates to KVO observing as the core of carousel.
- Added `.FloatWithSpacing()` and `.WithoutResizing()` implementations.

# 0.1
- Initial release.ðŸŽ‰
