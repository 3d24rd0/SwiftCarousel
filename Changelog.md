# 0.4
- ðŸš€Fixed bug when you spinned the carousel while it was spinning. When you did this, the carousel would mess up the destination target and wouldnâ€™t really select the item in the middle, but slightly off.

# 0.3
- Clicking (or tapping) on item now by default selects the item in carousel.

# 0.2.2
- Fixed `selectItem(_:animated)`.

# 0.2
- Moved from scroll delegates to KVO observing as the core of carousel.
- Added `.FloatWithSpacing()` and `.WithoutResizing()` implementations.

# 0.1
- Initial release.ðŸŽ‰
